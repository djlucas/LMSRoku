README

This project is simply a more complete sample, posted only as that, an example
and is only here for historical reasons. There are much better products
available now. Try Plex.

This was my first local media project which started from the TED example. I've
made some very simple changes like a 'Play All' button that plays all episodes
in the proper order (reversed so that chronological order is retained for left
to right viewing), some sample pictures for Kids stuff, movies, and TV icons,
etc, added ratings, support HD streams, etc. I called it LITS Media Server in
the sample. As you can see, the local name of the server on my network was
name64.lucasit.com, this should be changed, and I belive I have some sample xml
files as well. Making you own is kinda over rated, but does allow you to play
files that say rocksbox does not, mkv files for instance (which are not enabled
in this sample). I'll update that later. Anyway, everthing in this tree is free
for the taking, just figured I'd throw it up in case anybody found something
useful. After I get around to testing with this sample code again, I'll extend
it here too and include what I currently have in my internal one.
